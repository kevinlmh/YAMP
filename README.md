## Welcome to YAMP.

Yet Another Music Player (YAMP) is a simple, fast and robust cross-platform MP3 player. It started as a class project for CPSC-340 Software Engineering at Trinity College, Hartford, CT. YAMP is open-source and completely free (both beer and speech).

If you like YAMP, consider contributing code into YAMP and make it better. You can contribute by cloning it on your computer:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kevinlmh/YAMP.git
$ cd YAMP
```
Not very good with coding? Don't worry. You can help us with documentation or you can help us by making a donation.
